Scootplayer contains a number of experimental features. These are described below.

## Remote Control ##

Multiple Scootplayer instances can be controlled through a single remote control. See `remote/scootplayer_remote_control.py` for more details.

## VLC Emulation ##

Scootplayer can emulate VLC's MPEG-DASH playback behaviour. This is enabled using the `--vlc` flag. This is still an experimental feature, and likely to change as both VLC and Scootplayer are updated.
